## sorting_algorithms

### Mandatory Tasks(4)
1. File: 0-bubble_sort.c - Write a function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the Bubble sort algorithm
2. File: 1-insertion_sort_list.c - Write a function that sorts a doubly linked list of integers in ascending order using the Insertion sort algorithm
3. File: 2-selection_sort.c - Write a function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the Selection sort algorithm
4. File: 3-quick_sort.c - Write a function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the Selection sort algorithm

Files: [0-3]-O - Write in the file *-O, the big O notations of the time complexity of the Bubble, Insertion, Selection and Quick sort algorithms, with 1 notation per line:
* in the best case
* in the average case
* in the worst case
